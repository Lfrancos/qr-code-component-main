- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The reality is that this was a pretty simple challenge, it was good to see that I have learned something over the last few months and to be able to do this in half an hour is really encouraging.

### Continued development

Still I'm not sure if I should be using the 'vh' as a mesure for the height, that means that it is giving a constraint height and may be very bad for responsive websites, I need to figure out what is the best way to make that responsive while keeping it in the middle of the screen.
